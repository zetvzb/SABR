You will see my power rankings projections. This is an objective power rankings model that I created in 2016 that accurately reflects teams based on no maninpulation. Just calculatable statistics with weights. I post tabulated results from these power rankings on my baseball twitter blog @StatsBaseball. This is an excel model.
